# Fruit shopping app demo

A demo for [Fenders February](https://www.meetup.com/Front-End-Web-Developers-Perth/events/258689280/) to show how I would build a simple app using [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org) & [styled-components](https://styled-components.com).

You can check it out on CodeSandbox [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/qv75m5l8q4) or run it locally with:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run local dev server
yarn start
```

or with npm:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Built using [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/)  
Inspiration from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/5987436-Grocery-Delivery-iOS-App)

Some other related things in the CSS-in-JS ecosystem:
- [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) - what `rebass` is built using. great way to extend styled-components to build a consistent library of components

- [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) - alternative to styled-components

- [polished](https://polished.js.org) - utility library, great for working with colours - e.g. [`lighten`](https://polished.js.org/docs/#lighten)
